        <p>Hi! or Nyob Zoo as I say in Hmong.  You can call me Mai (pronounced like 'my'). I went to school at UW Madison 
            and graduated with a Zoology degree. Most people say I must love animals. Well, actully you can do so much more with the Zoology degree. I initially
            wanted to work in a lab and study cancer. Well, by my junior year, I was like, "What the heck am I
            doing?!" So then I started to have interest in the public health and somehow ended up in the Medicaid
            insurance company doing community health. I love this because I work with low income folks and help them get
            assistance with healthcare and community resources.

        <p>Okay enough about work and school. Let's focus on the fun stuff! I like to watch comedy movies. I like Chuck
            Norris jokes. I am almost the middle child? I say that with a question mark because in total, my siblings
            and I equals 8. Yes, a big family but a wonderful family! We all moved to different parts of WI after
            finishing college. I wanted to own my own bakery when I was little. Funny thing is, I'm not a good baker! My little
            sister is actually very good at baking and decorating. I did work at a bakery for almost a year
            and they taught me how to decorate, which I loved. It's so much fun. It's actually my hidden talent!</p>
